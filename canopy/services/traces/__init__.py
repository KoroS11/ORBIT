"""Reasoning trace fanout.

Every visible step in the Sense → Attribute → Decide pipeline emits a
:class:`ReasoningTrace` to the bus on topic ``traces.{stage}``. The frontend
subscribes via the gateway's WebSocket fanout and renders the stream in a
terminal-styled panel; the resulting log is the auditable explanation of
why the engine arrived at its assessment.

The :class:`Tracer` is a thin façade so services do not have to know the
topic naming convention or how to build the event. One Tracer is shared
across all services, wired in :func:`canopy._engine.build_engine`.
